    "- **Total Weighted Distance**: The solution has a total weighted distance of approximately 143.1. This metric helps the decision maker understand the overall efficiency and cost of the current SR (Sales Representatives) allocation.\n",

    "- **Weight Balance**: Each SR has a total weight within the constraint interval (between 0.8 and 1.2), indicating a balanced workload. SRs 1, 2, and 3 are near the upper limit, while SR 4 is close to the minimum requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distance Distribution**: SRs 1 and 4 have significantly higher total distances (64.37 and 76.13 respectively) compared to SRs 2 and 3 (7.53 and 6.57). This suggests that SRs 1 and 4 cover more geographically dispersed bricks, which may imply higher travel times or costs.\n",
